Check wheather your machine has node js already installed 





if no then install it from your favorite browser 




then install react js using the following command





npm install -g create-react-app





wait for a while it will take some time to install 





once the installation is completed then install vite package to install vite in your machine open terminal window and type the following command 
npm install vite





similarly it will take some time and once installation is done we can create our first applicaiton 





to create first application create a empty folder and then open the folder in your suitable code editor in my case i used vs code on mac os 





open terminal window in vs code and then type the following command in the window then type the following command 
npm create vite@latest 





then it will ask for destinatio folder name if you want to create a folder inside the existing folder give the name of the folder or just press period( . ) to make use of the folder you currently in.
then select react 





then select javascript + swc or just javascript(only if your machine doesn't support it) 





it will take sometime then it will display 2 - 3 commands like cd <foldername> then "npm run dev"





once all done you will see a local host web address in mac press cmd+click on trackpad in windows copy the link and paste it on your personal web browser.
